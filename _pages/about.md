I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the Department of Agricultural and Applied Economics at the University of Wisconsin–Madison.

I am an applied microeconomist with broad interests in environmental and natural resource economics. My current research examines the environmental and economic impacts of U.S. environmental policies and institutions. Specifically, I study the effects of voluntary federal conservation programs on nonpoint source pollution and how the adjudication of water rights affects agricultural land values in the United States. 

I will be on the 2025–2026 economics job market.
