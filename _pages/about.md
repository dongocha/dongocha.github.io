I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the Department of Agricultural and Applied Economics at the University of Wisconsin–Madison.

I am an applied microeconomist with broad interests in environmental and natural resource economics. My current research examines the environmental and economic impacts of U.S. environmental policies and institutions. Specifically, I study the effects of voluntary federal conservation programs on nonpoint source pollution and how the adjudication of water rights affects agricultural land values in the United States. I am also interested in the application of machine learning in economic research. In one of my projects, I fine-tuned BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), a pre-trained language model, to detect subjectivity in environmental academic writing.

I will be on the 2025–2026 economics job market.

Feel free to reach out to me at [ntdo2@wisc.edu](mailto:ntdo2@wisc.edu).

Upcoming presentations:
- AAEA Summer Meeting July 27 - 29 in Denver, CO.
- Camp Resources XXXI August 3 - 5 in Asheville, NC.
