Hello! Thanks for visiting. I am a (rising) sixth-year PhD student in the Department of Agricultural and Applied Economics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I do research on the economics of the environment & natural resources, with particular emphasis on conservation and water. I expect to be on the 2025-2026 job market.
