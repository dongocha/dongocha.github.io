    Non-point source pollution remains a leading cause of water quality issues in the U.S. Nearly half of the country's rivers and streams experience increasing levels of phosphorus and nitrogen, which poses significant threats to aquatic ecosystems and human health. Agriculture is the largest contributor to this pollution. As part of efforts to address this issue, the U.S. has invested billions of dollars annually in voluntary conservation programs that incentivize farmers to retire cropland, yet empirical evidence on their effectiveness in improving water quality remains limited. In this paper, I contribute to the understanding of the effectiveness of conservation programs by assessing the impacts of the Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP) on water quality in Wisconsin. Leveraging water quality measurements from over 14,000 monitoring stations and CREP contract data in Wisconsin during four decades (1980–2023), I employ a triple differences framework to estimate the effects of conservation on downstream water quality. Results show that CREP significantly reduces nitrate and ammonia concentrations downstream, indicating improved water quality, while effects on phosphorus are inconsistent. Legacy effects are observed for nitrate, whereas ammonia improvements are more localized. These findings offer additional empirical evidence on the environmental benefits of conservation programs and could help guide more targeted, effective strategies to mitigate nonpoint source pollution in the U.S

- **The Economic Benefits of Water Rights Adjudication: Evidence from Agricultural Land Sales in Western States**

   <small>
Water is an essential but increasingly scarce resource, especially in the Western U.S., where climate change and institutional fragmentation make efficient water regulation challenging. Adjudication, a legal process to formalize and clarify water rights, has emerged as part of efforts to establish clearer and enforceable rights. Despite its potential economic and environmental benefits, empirical evidence of the impacts of water rights adjudication remains limited. In this paper, I examine the effects of irrigation water rights adjudication on agricultural land and rural home values in Idaho. Using a repeated sales sample and a newly compiled water rights dataset, I employ a hedonic pricing model to estimate capitalization effects of adjudicated appurtenant irrigation rights. The main findings show that adjudicated rights significantly increase land value. The treatment effect evaluated at the sample mean implies an increase in a parcel’s land value by \$381 per acre. Moreover, adjudication effects are highly heterogeneous. I find that adjudication effects are larger for agricultural parcels with greater water rights allocation. In particular, downstream water users do not gain from adjudication, but holding senior water rights helps offset this disadvantage. These findings suggest that while adjudication can enhance the market value of water, it does not make all users better off, which raises distributional concerns that should be carefully considered in the design of future water policies.

 - **Science and Subjectivity in Academic Research on the Environment** (draft coming soon)

   <summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
   <small>
Objective science uncovers truths about environmental conditions, including those related to emissions trends, biodiversity loss, and climate change. When and why do scientists use subjective language to describe these conditions with bias, emotion, or advocacy?  To shed light, we study determinants and trends in subjective language use within journal articles published since 1990 in the science and social science fields. Using machine learning to label and score abstract wording by subjectivity, we find evidence that subjective language is more prevalent in articles focused on environmental topics. Among economic journals, subjective language is also increasing over time. After controlling for factors such as article age, author experience, number of authors, and journal quality, higher subjectivity scores associate positively with academic citations, particularly if the article is focused on an environmental topic. This finding suggests that subjective language may be rewarded in the academy.
